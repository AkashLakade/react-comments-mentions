### Hooks Implementation (Typescript)
Following is a basic example to start testing the library in your project. This library works on a user basis
system and here are a few important points to remember:

- currentUser[required]. For no user details pass the prop as currentUser={null}
- A new user can be redirected using the login/signup links in the logIn[required] prop.
- The currentData[optional] prop returns an object of current data available after any action such as comment submission, reply, edit or delete.
- The onSubmitAction returns an object of data with the required information to make an API call after a comment is submitted.
